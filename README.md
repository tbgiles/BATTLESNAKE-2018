# BATTLESNAKE 2018
## A BattleSnake competition AI written by me!
## (Written in Python with gUnicorn and Flask!)

To run this AI:
  1. Register with Heroku
  2. Make a copy of this repo and aim your Heroku project at it (see settings in Heroku)
  3. Aim the BattleSnake client at the app's URL
### Depending on the client's config, the URL might need to NOT have the '/' at the end.
